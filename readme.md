#Optical Properties of tissue

This is a repo to store any optical properties I come across during my PhD.

These optical properties will take the form of scattering, absorption and fluorescence spectrums.

As optical properties vary vastily from tissue sample to tisue sample there will be multiple data files for some tissue/chromophores. These data files will also include experimental fits and theortical expressions for tissues.


###ToDo 

* Add files
* Add sources for data
* Add units for all files
* Add headers for files
